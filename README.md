Replication for Munger (2019) -- Mapping Politics on YouTube

The jupyter notebooks provide code for scraping the YouTube API. (I am not good at python, sorry).

These two:

*ain_scraping.ipynb* & *msm_scraping.ipynb*

collect all of the videos and video metadata for these two groups of media producers (see paper for details).

This one:

*testing_search.ipynb*

scrapes the search API for different search queries, every month from 2006 - 2018.


The R files take this data, pre-process it and plot it.
